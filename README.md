CODING DECISIONS 

1. The use of Boootstrap

Bootstrap was used because it is a consistent that supports major of all browsers and CSS compatibility fixes.
It's safe, has fewer cross browser bugs.
It has responsive structures and styles, good documentation and community support.

2. Added 'Back' buttons

These buttons were added to make the user experince easier, the user can have an option to go back to the previous input and edit data should he/she find the need to do so.

3. The use of jquery progress alert
This is to ensure that the user sees progress and has clear knowledge of the length of the form.
